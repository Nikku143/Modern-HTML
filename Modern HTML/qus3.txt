ANS:-

Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible.
 We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits 
 other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.


 Building accessible sites benefits everyone:

Semantic HTML, which improves accessibility, also improves SEO, making your site more findable.
Caring about accessibility demonstrates good ethics and morals, which improves your public image.
Other good practices that improve accessibility also make your site more usable by other groups, such as mobile phone users or those on low network speed. In fact, everyone can benefit from many such improvements.
